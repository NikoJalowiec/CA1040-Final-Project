            Description
        </h2>
        <p>Millie was a Jack Russel terrier. She was mostly white with spots of black on her ears an on her right side. 
        Her full name is Millenium Dot Com as she was born around the turn of the millenium.</p>
        

        <h2>
            Personality
        </h2>
        <p>Due to the fact I was very young when we had her, I don't remember much of her personality. 
            What I do remember is her being more cranky during her later years, but according to my family she was very caring and loving.</p>
