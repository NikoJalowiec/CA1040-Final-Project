            Description
        </h2>
        <p>Jaxon is an olde English bulldogge. He is brown with a tigerstripe pattern on his body. He has a black snout,
            and has white on his chest and on his feet.

            Personality
        </h2>
        <p>
            Jaxon is a baby in every sense of the word. Even as he's gotten older, he has remained extremely playful. However this also comes with him
            being a complete scardy cat, being a very anxious dog who is also scared of the dark. Despite his anxiety and fear he is very loyal and tries his
            best to be protective of my family. As a puppy he was very adept at escaping the pen we built for him, always finding some flaw in the design,
            but he has luckily not kept up that habit as he's gotten older, especially since we know he could jump over the fence we have for their outdoor
            area during the winter when the snow piles up near the fence.
