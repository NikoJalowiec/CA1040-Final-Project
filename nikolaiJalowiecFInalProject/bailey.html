            Description
        </h2>
        <p>
            Bailey is a miniature bulldog. She is mostly beige in color with a black snout, black lines near her eyes resembling eye-liner, and white dots on the front and back of her head.
            She is built like a brick, so despite her smaller stature she is tough and sturdy.

            Personality
        </h2>
        <p>
            Bailey is, like all bulldogs, very stubborn, but she is especially so. I'd describe her personality as being the dog version of a Karen.
            Her preferred method of asking for things is grumbling and barking paired with stern looks. Despite this, she is actually quite friendly.
            She always wags her tail when she sees you approaching and gets very excited when people come home or visit.
            Her favorite pass time is finding a comfy cushion to burry her face in then sleeping with someone petting her.
