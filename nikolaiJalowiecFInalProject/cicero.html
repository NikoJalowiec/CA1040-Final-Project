            Description
        </h2>
        <p>Cicero was an olde English bulldogge. He was all brown save for his snout and around his eyes which are black.
            He was very large for his breed due to having more mastiff in his ancestory compared to most olde English bulldogges.

            Personality
        </h2>
        <p>Cicero was very clever and had a sense of humor. On several occasions he tricked my other dog <a href="bailey.html">Bailey</a> to take her spot or a toy he wanted.
            He also enjoyed playing pranks, especially on my mom. He'd drink some water to be extra slobbery and then he'd lick her foot causing her to yell in surprise.
            He was also the only dog I've ever had who actually burried bones. As a puppy he'd try and fail to hide bones in obvious places, but he got better as he got older.
            Towards the end of his life he always had a secret stache of his favorite toys hidden in his dog bed.
